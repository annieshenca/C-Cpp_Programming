/*
Lowest Common Ancestor Problem
Option #1: Na√Øve Algorithm
    Time Complexity: O(h) with h meaning the max distance of root to from a leaf.
    Steps:
	    1. From u, go all the way up to the root and record all vertices along the way.
	    2. From v, same thing go up to root, but stop if we encounter a common vertex for the first time.
